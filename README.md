# TrajectIO

This is an experimental game I've been working on recently. It's a cell-based game, much like AgarIO and SlitherIO, but it is unique in its own ways. The multi-player version of TrajectIO is not near completion, even though some of the client-server communication logic is coded.

A client-side-only version of this app is available at the above link. Feel free to take a gander.


## Pre-requisites

1) NodeJS

2) NPM

3) SocketIO

4) ExpressJS

## Instructions

1) Clone from Github

2) Run "npm install" to install the necessary packages

3) Run "npm start" to run the services


## README

This game is experimental and not completed yet. If you want to try this game, I recommend that you only use the client version for now, which can be used by replacing the file at client/js/app.js with the code inside client_side_only.js.

Alternatively, I have exactly that set up at http://traject.io/ if you would rather take a look there.
